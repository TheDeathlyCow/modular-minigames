**The TNS Minigame server is now open!!**

Choo choo! All aboard for minigames! The minigame server is now open with Bed Wars and Spleef. 

My lovely builders and I have created four maps for these minigames for launch, these are:

**The Tower - Spleef**
**TNT Mall - TNT Spleef**
**TotallyNotHockey - Spleef**
**Castle in the Sky - Bed Wars**

More maps coming soon! 

_**Where is it?**_

Go to the coordinates `499 70 -1806` (spawn) and head all the way down the staircase to the train platform. Simply board either of the trains to be taken to the minigame server!

_**How do I play?**_

Once on the minigame server, simply purchase a map ticket either from one of the ticket masters, or with the ticket book, then board one of the trains on the *upper* floor and you will be transported to that map! **Important note:** Boarding the train on the underground platform will take you back to survival, not to a minigame. 

Once you've entered a minigame, right click on the green shield when you are ready. Once all players have readied up, the countdown will begin. 

_**How do I get back to spawn?**_

Simply board the train on the underground platform, and you will be taken back to spawn.

_**How many people are required to play?**_

All minigames require a minimum of 2 players to play, and Bed Wars has a maximum of 12 players while Spleef has no maximum. Of course, the more the merrier! 

_**I have an issue with a minigame, please help!**_
