A new minigame has been added to the minigame server: **Parkour!**

To play, travel to the minigame hub via spawn, and either go to page 4 of your ticket book or purchase a ticket from a ticket master if your book is not updated and board a train on platforms 2-5, as you would any other minigame.

The parkour minigame is a singleplayer minigame with a competitive scoreboard for the best times. The leaderboard for an arena is displayed in your sidebar whenever you are in that arena. Each map has a certain benchmark time set by its creator, and the first person to beat that time will get a special award! 

These times are:
AquaticTemple by @Vaipereq#6843: 39.238s
MossyCaves by @TheDeathlyCow#1989: 44.500s
Reflections by @Goldkey#5666 : 13.485s

The first person to beat this time will be given the creator's head that, when worn, provides you with +5 maximum hearts and has the same armour rating as a diamond helmet! To submit a time, please DM @TheDeathlyCow#1989 with a screenshot of the leaderboard of the map, clearly showing both your time and the creator's time. 

As an extra challenge, the first person to complete the MossyCaves parkour map under the following times will receive the increasingly more powerful boots of Talaria. A rare set of diamond boots that provide the wearer with additional speed, as a testament to their parkour skill!  

120s - +5% speed when worn
90s  - +10% speed when worn
60s  - +15% speed when worn
30s  - +25% speed when worn, and also increased attack speed
